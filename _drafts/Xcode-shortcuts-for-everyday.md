I've just finished preparing my coffee.. ♨!!
<br>
It's always a happy and warm moment, but this time it `feels special`.. My blog is finally back to life and I am excited to use this space to share some nerdy stuff.

Grab your ☕️.. I promise it won't get cold neither unpleaseant to drink, since this post is all about coffee.
<br>
Wait...coffee? Xcode shortcuts? What the hell?

In this post I'll share some basic `built-in Xcode shortcuts` that can speed up development in a `daily basis` - `just like coffee`!

Well Xcode is not the most loved tool around, that's for sure! There are many things we wish were better, I'll just drop here "lack of incremental updates".. yes, pretty sad! In the other hand knowing its corners and a few tricks can make a `huge difference` on how `satisfaying` is working with it.

###### `Open Quickly`
`⌘ + ⇧ + o`
<br>
We often work with huge projects that have tons of targets / folders / files, which makes pretty hard to find what we want. 
This command presents a global search bar that can filter almost everything, file name, functions, properties..

`When selecting through open quickly`
<br>
`⌥ [+ ⇧] + ↵`
<br>
By selecting the desired result with the keys `Option + Enter` the file gets opened in an additional editor. Add the `Shift key` to the mix to enable selecting with the keyboard directionals or mouse/trackpad the exact place to open the file.

###### `Open current file on project navigator` 
`⌘ + ⇧ + J`
<br>
It's pretty nice to find the selected file in the project navigator.

###### `Navigate recent files` 
`⌘ + ⌃ + [←/→]`
<br>
Use this command to navigate back and forward the recent files.

###### `Open/hide debug debug area`
`⌘ + ⇧ + Y`
<br>
Use it to quickly show or hide the debug area in the bottom of Xcode.

###### `Close/hide the Navigator`
`⌘ + 0`
<br>
Use it to quickly show or hide the left panel (Navigator).

###### `Close/hide Inspectors`
`⌘ + ⌥ + 0`
<br>
Use it to quickly show or hide the right panel (Inspectors).

###### `Open/change the Navigator tab`
`⌘ + 1...9`
<br>
Can be used to quickly select a Navigator tab, such as the issue navigator (5).

###### `Shows the find navigation with the search field selected`
`⌘ + ⇧ + F`
<br>
Useful to open the find navigator tab in search mode. Just type the text and be happy!

###### `Open scheme selector` 
`⌃ + 0`
<br>
Open the scheme selector where to change the current scheme.

## What else?

I believe that `learning` combined with `practicing` are key ingredients towards `getting better`.
Coffee is kind of the same, griding some fancy grains, putting up the exact temperature, the correct weight, using the best techniques and experience will make a high quality app... ohh, I mean, coffee!

Achieving a very nice `workflow` is also a matter of `practice`. Shortcuts along with more advanced techniques can help in this task.

The `shortcuts` presented here are straightforward and ready to use `without any further Xcode customization`. Moving forward, when it starts to get automatic, I encourage you to explore `Xcode's key bindins and behaviors`.

Ping me on Twitter, reach out, comment with the shortcuts you use each and every-day.. let's share! By the way, if you have coffee and don't mind sharing..

See you around and thanks for reading ;).
