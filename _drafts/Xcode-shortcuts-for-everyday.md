I've just finished preparing my coffee. Yeahh!! It's always a happy and worm moment, but this time is even more special.. My blog is finally back to life and I am excited to use this space to share my experiences. Grab your ☕️.. I promise it won't get cold, neither unpleaseant, since this post is all about coffee. But.. coffee Xcode shortcuts? What the hell? In this post I'll share some simple and easy to remember Xcode shortcuts that make our life as developers more pleasent in a daily basis - just like coffee!

Well Xcode is not the most loved tool around, and that's for sure. There are many things we wish were better, I can just mention lack of support for incremental updates.. yeah, pretty sad! In the other hand knowing its corners and a few tricks can make our life much better, smelling like coffee.. hmmm!

## Daily shortcuts

### Open Quickly ⌘ + ⇧ + o (Command + Shift + "o")
We often work on gigantic projects with tons of targets, folders and files, which make pretty hard to find what we want. 
This command presents a global search bar and it can filter almost everything, file name, functions, properties..

#### Extra tip ⌥ [+ ⇧] + ↵ (Option [+ Shift] + Enter)
By selecting the desired result with Enter + Option the file can be opened in an additional editor.
There's always the option to also hold the shift key and select with the directionals the exect place where the file is going to be opened.

### Open current file on project navigator ⌘ + ⇧ + J (Command + Shift + "j")
It's pretty nice! Usually we also want to find the selected file in the project navigation, which can be easily done with this command.

### Navigate recent files ⌘ + ⌃ + [←/→] (Command + Control + left / right)
Use this command to navigate back and forward the recent files.

### Open/hide debug debug area ⌘ + ⇧ + Y (Command + Shift + y)
Use it to quickly show or hide the debug area in the bottom of Xcode.

### Close/Hide the Navigator ⌘ + 0 (Command + zero)
Use it to quickly show or hide the left panel, the Navigator.

### Close/Hide Inspectors ⌘ + ⌥ + 0 (Command + Option + zero)
Use it to quickly show or hide the right panel, the Inspectors.

### Open/change the Navigator tab ⌘ + 1...9 (Command + 1 to 9)
Can be used to quickly select a Navigator tab, such as 5 the issue navigator.

### Show the find navigation with the search field selected ⌘ + ⇧ + F (Command + Shift + f)
Nice to directly open the fin navigator tab ready to search something. Just type the text and be happy!

### Open scheme selector ⌃ + 0 (Control + 0)
Open the scheme selector where to change the current scheme.

## What else?

Just like coffee shortcutes and speeding up our workflow is a matter of practice.
This shortcuts as previously said are quite simple, you can start using them now, without any further Xcode customization.
Moving forward, when they start to get automatic I encourage you to explore Xcode's key bindins and behaviors, to keep thing even more automated. Who knows, maybe we can talk about some nice custom key bindigs set ups for Xcode and tips on how behavior can speed up your life here in the future.. doors are open.. with some coffee all is possible.

See you around and thanks for reading ;).
