Hi. I'm a sofware engineer specialized in iOS and Swift development.

In my 10 years of experience I have worked on different fields, the latest 5 at [GetYourGuide](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/getyourguide-travel-tickets/id705079381), where I have had the pleasure to work with amazing people and developed myself into a Staff Engineer.

I do have years of experience as a platform engineer, in which I drove initiatives across teams and played an important role on scaling Native Apps.

DevOps, Modularization, Architecture and Automated Testing are among the areas I dove into over the years. Besides my specialization I also like to learn new technologies, currently I'm studying compilers and progressing as a backend engineer.

## Open Source

I do appreciate and contribute to the Open Source landscape, where besides contributions to others, I do have a few of my own projects.
